A very simple update manager for Electron apps on Windows OS

This is a collection of useful functions for apps for Windows maded with Electron to update them in an easy way. You only have to add this package to your app and execute two functions to perform an update of the app itself.

For the moment this package support only Windows but in the future I will support other OS.
